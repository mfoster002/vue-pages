      I love pizza. Pizza fills me up and I bake it from scratch monthly
      freeze the dough often. I love pizza. Pizza fills me up and i bake it from
      scratch monthly and freeze the dough often.<br><br>
      On a day I don't feel like cooking, I always know there is pizza dough waiting for me that still tastes fresh! Just thaw it in the refrigerator and it easy to add fresh sauce and tons of toppings!<br><br>
      I also love expressing myself through art and decor.
